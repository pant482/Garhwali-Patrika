**Garhwali Patrika** – A News Website Project 📰  

This repository contains the development of **Garhwali Patrika**, a news website aimed at providing news in the **Garhwali language** for the locals of **Uttarakhand, India**. The project focuses on delivering regional news, culture, and important updates in a language familiar to the people of Garhwal.  

### Key Features:  
🌍 **News in Garhwali** – Bringing local news in the native language.  
📱 **Responsive Design** – Accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.  
📰 **Categorized News** – Covering politics, culture, weather, and regional updates.  
🔧 **Tech Stack** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend integration (TBD).  

I'll keep adding and updating files, as the project makes more progress.

This project is a step toward preserving and promoting the **Garhwali language** in the digital space. 🚀
